# PSTAT-131-Final-Project
## Introduction
This project will be about to find the best model to predict whether a debtor is defaulting their loan or not. The dataset contains 12 predictors and 1 response. In todays world, financial banking mostly generate profit from loans. If a bank give a loan to a debtor that is unable to pay back then it will be a very high credit risk. So this project objective is to minimize that credit risk by making a model with the 12 predictors to predict the response in hoping to see which charactheristic of individuals is most likely to default their loans.

In this project, I will be first doing Exploratory Data Analysis. I will look through the spread of the response and how its distributed. Then I will see how each variables correlate with one another. After doing EDA, I then will proceed to split and cross validate the data. After splitting and cross validation is done, I will then build 3 models (Logistic Regression, Tree Classifciation Model & Boosted Tree Models). Each model will have parameters that are tune to achive the best model. The metric I use for validating it to be the best model is by looking at the ROC_AUC.
